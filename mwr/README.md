# Microwave Radiometer (MWR)

Raw MWR data are available via the [Planetary Data System](https://pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu/PDS/data/jnomwr_1100/), but we displayed processed versions of the data in Fletcher et al. (2025).  This sub-directory contains the following data:

* `mwr_global_PJ3-40.zip`: Zip directory contains `.png` files used to assemble the global views of MWR data in the appendices.  These are shown for both unfiltered (i.e., no correction for synchrotron and auroral contamination) and filtered (with synchotron/auroras filtered out), and for both polar equidistant projections, and Mollweide projections.
